**word_guessing:**
A simple word guessing game that selects a random word from the file 'words.txt', and prompts user to input letters until they manage to guess the word correctly. In order to run properly, make sure the file 'words.txt' is in the same directory as the 'word_guessing.py' file. In order to use a different set of words, just replace the content of the 'words.txt' file, but make sure each word is on a separate line.

**cows_bulls:**
A simple number guessing game. User is prompted to input a number made up of 4 digits. For every correct digit the user guesses also in the correct index, they get a cow. For every correct digit in an incorrect index, they get a bull. The program prints the number of guesses needed at the end.
